[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and Semantic Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Codex-only 0.6.0 pending release with configured native routine, high, and advisor role adapters.
- Fail-closed persistence, preview, installation, recovery, and runtime-evidence checks for the native role configuration.

### Changed

- Each configured native role now requires an exact non-empty model and `model_reasoning_effort` identifier before it can be saved or rendered.
- The parent orchestrator continues to inherit the parent chat selection; its optional recommendation effort is not a configured native role requirement.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Canonical Agent Plugins v1 manifest alongside the Codex adapter manifest.
- Lazy parent-chat setup interview and fail-closed setup gate.
- Cross-client configuration and native adapters for Codex, Cursor, VS Code/Copilot, and Kiro.
- Bun stdio MCP server with safe preview, consent, install, validation, reset, and uninstall tools.
- Durable, private configuration state and transactional managed-file recovery.
- Pinned plugin/MCP schemas, CI, tag parity, flattened release gates, and comprehensive security/runtime tests.
- Explicit user-visible Luna / Max app-task lane with parent-owned review and acceptance.

### Changed

- The orchestrator now inherits the parent chat's selected model and effort.
- Routine, high-complexity, and advisor roles use exact user-selected native IDs.
- Retained native Codex delivery on Terra / High with a fresh Sol / High review.
- Retired the Luna native companion role while preserving exact legacy migration.
